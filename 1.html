            <h1>To Travel is to Live</h1>
            <p>Often times, I stop and reflect on how travel has changed my life. 
                During these times, I realize how much travel is a part of me. 
                During my teenage years, I would read books and wonder what it would be like to go to all these exotic places.
                I never thought this was possible for me but alas, travel opened up so many doors and opportunities for me that often times, I have to pinch myself. 
                For me, travel is living. It is seizing each day and making the most out of every situation.
                
                For me, travel is experiencing things beyond the usual and is consistently challenging, exciting, and fulfilling. 
                I love the quote  “The life you have led doesn’t need to be the only life you have.” by Anna Quindlen because I have reinvented myself so many times.
